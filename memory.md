# Harsh Realms Campaign - Development Log

## 2025-06-18 07:30 - Initial Concept Discussion

### Core Vision
- **Tone**: Realistic with horror elements at low levels
- **World**: Harsh and unforgiving, survival is an accomplishment
- **Structure**: Sandbox with reactive antagonists pursuing independent agendas
- **Magic**: Rare for humanoids, magic items extremely valuable
- **System**: D&D 2024, focusing on levels 1-10
- **Players**: 4-6 expected

### Key Inspirations
- **Kenshi**: Post-apocalyptic survival, no chosen one narrative
- **Dune**: Resource scarcity, political intrigue, mystical elements rare/dangerous
- **Dark Sun**: Harsh desert world, magic is dangerous
- **The Mandalorian**: Frontier survival, precious technology/artifacts

### Design Goals
- Living world that doesn't revolve around PCs but reacts to them
- Consequences matter, actions have weight
- Avoid high-level D&D complexity by focusing on low levels
- Create meaningful survival and resource management

### Next Steps
- Establish core setting concept and geography
- Define magic restrictions and alternative power sources
- Create initial antagonist factions with independent goals
- Design starting region and key settlements
