# Harsh Realms Campaign - Development Log

## 2025-06-18 07:30 - Initial Concept Discussion

### Core Vision
- **Tone**: Realistic with horror elements at low levels
- **World**: Harsh and unforgiving, survival is an accomplishment
- **Structure**: Sandbox with reactive antagonists pursuing independent agendas
- **Magic**: Rare for humanoids, magic items extremely valuable
- **System**: D&D 2024, focusing on levels 1-10
- **Players**: 4-6 expected

### Key Inspirations
- **Kenshi**: Post-apocalyptic survival, no chosen one narrative
- **Dune**: Resource scarcity, political intrigue, mystical elements rare/dangerous
- **Dark Sun**: Harsh desert world, magic is dangerous
- **The Mandalorian**: Frontier survival, precious technology/artifacts

## 2025-06-18 07:45 - Magic System & Faction Refinements

### Wild Magic Danger System
- **Cantrips**: Safe to cast
- **1st Level**: 1/20 chance for Wild Magic Table 1 (rarely dangerous)
- **2nd Level**: 1/2 chance for Wild Magic Table 1
- **3rd Level+**: Guaranteed Table 1 effect
- **4th-6th Level**: Wild Magic Table 2 (mildly dangerous, rarely catastrophic)
- **7th-9th Level**: Wild Magic Table 3 (always catastrophic)

**Magic as Dying Art**: Very few living practitioners, only brightest minds can apprentice

### Magic Items Economy
- Nearly indestructible without magic
- Common/uncommon non-consumables: Carefully guarded but present in settlements
- Rare+ items: Truly rare (destroyed/hidden + fewer originally made)

### Geography
- **Biomes**: Desert, wasteland, savanna
- **Settlements**: Located at rare green oases

### Faction Structure
1. **Human bandit leader/Thri-kreen slaver** (secretly backed by...)
2. **Trading coalition of the three settlements**
3. **The Old Monarch (warforged)** - ultimate threat

### Next Development
- Specific antagonist agendas and timelines
- Available races for PCs
- Starting region geography and settlements
- Wild magic tables (later priority)
