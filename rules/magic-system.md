# Wild Magic System

## Magic Corruption Mechanics

Magic has become increasingly unstable since the collapse. The higher the spell level, the more dangerous it becomes to cast.

### Spell Level Risk Table

| Spell Level | Wild Magic Chance | Table Used | Notes |
|-------------|------------------|------------|--------|
| Cantrips | 0% | None | Completely safe |
| 1st Level | 5% (1/20) | Table 1 | Rarely dangerous |
| 2nd Level | 50% (1/2) | Table 1 | Rarely dangerous |  
| 3rd Level | 100% | Table 1 | Guaranteed effect |
| 4th-6th Level | 100% | Table 2 | Mildly dangerous always, rarely catastrophic |
| 7th-9th Level | 100% | Table 3 | Always catastrophic |

### Wild Magic Tables

**Table 1 (Levels 1-3)**: Minor chaos, rarely dangerous
- Mostly cosmetic or minor inconvenience effects
- Occasional beneficial effects
- Very rare actual danger

**Table 2 (Levels 4-6)**: Moderate chaos, consistent danger
- Always creates some form of problem or complication
- Rarely catastrophic but consistently troublesome
- Effects that might alert enemies, waste resources, or create social problems

**Table 3 (Levels 7-9)**: Major chaos, always catastrophic  
- Effects that endanger the caster and everyone nearby
- Potential for permanent consequences
- Why almost no one attempts high-level magic

### Magic as a Lost Art

- Very few living practitioners exist
- Only the brightest minds can hope to find and apprentice under a master
- Most people fear magic due to stories of past catastrophes
- Knowledge is jealously guarded by the few who possess it

## Character Creation Implications

### Starting Classes
- **Full Access**: Fighter, Rogue, Barbarian, Monk
- **Conditional**: Ranger (may retain limited spellcasting due to low power level)
- **Feat Access**: Magic Initiate, Ritual Caster (with wild magic risks)

### Multiclass Progression
Magic classes can be unlocked through significant story events:
- **Cleric**: Divine intervention, blessing from a deity
- **Warlock**: Pact with an extraplanar entity
- **Wild Magic Sorcerer**: Surviving magical catastrophe, exposure to raw magic
- **Wizard**: Finding ancient texts, apprenticing under a master
- All require appropriate narrative justification and often come with story complications
